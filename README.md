# Liassistant

## Description

The LIA project (as apart of NewHacks 2022) is designed to assist patients with dementia by using artificial intelligence to help them remember important information and communicate with others when they may not have the means to.

This project aims to improve the quality of life for individuals with dementia, aiding their cognitive functions and enhancing their ability to communicate without the intervention of a guardian.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Questions:** Firstly, in order to train the model we have a training phase where we pose a set of questions specific to the patient with the presence of their guardian so we can deduce the difference between the patients answers and the guardians.

- **Personalized Reminders** In order to "teach" the patient or help them ro remember certain key events the patient will be provided reminders (through the form of notifications) through out the day.

- **Artificial Intelligence:** Leveraging AI the system refines the reminders and questions to better suit the individual patient's requirements.

- **Chat Interface:** The app would offer a channel unique to each patient where others communicating the patient can "listen in". A user can then speak to the patient, the audio will be transcrbed as text and showed on the patients device and vice-versa. However, in the case where a pateint does not know the answer to a question or answers incorrectly our AI can interject and the user listening in will be showed a suggestion of what the patient meant.

## Roadmap

Currently this project is dormant and we are no longer contributing to it.
